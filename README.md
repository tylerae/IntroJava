# Overview

## The aim of this project was to learn the basics of Java. I also wanted to dive into rest api's so i combined the two concepts to create a rest api using Java.

# Development Environment

## For this project, I used quite a few different tools. As for my IDE, I like Intelli J, which seems to be a popular choice for Java. I followed a tutorial for Java that mentiioned many libraries but Spark and OrmLite are used for this project. I also am interacting with a SQL database.

# Future Work

* I want to work on this program and implement more abstraction. This will make the code more readable and maluable
* I would work on the data itself to have a more purposefull program.
